## Introduction
When we want to travel from one place to the other, one of the effective ways of doing would be to book cabs. There are a lot of services such as [Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/s/d/kochab/?ad_id=562430274936&adg_id=122583522621&campaign_id=14241218849&cre=562430274936&dev=c&dev_m=&fi_id=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2ZCOBhDiARIsAMRfv9LnwQ76YLGjYfVhJ75p_PL03RxvoxfRvoCLVBtT6aezSfrLta8QLTMaAhzOEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&kw=uber&kwid=kwd-169801042&match=e&net=g&placement=&tar=&utm_campaign=CM2141173-search-google-brand_1_6_US-Boston_driver_web_acq_cpc_en_Generic_Exact_uber_kwd-169801042_562430274936_122583522621_e_c&utm_source=AdWords_Brand) and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/drive-with-lyft?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PAID_DAX_SRCH_US_PRO_WEB_DESK_BRND_LYFT_EXACT&adgroup=lyft_NA_NA&utm_term=lyft&device=c&matchtype=e&targetid=aud-445253257374:kwd-158399963&loc_physical_ms=9061331&loc_interest_ms=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&campaign_id=1447389321&ad_id=511938195020&adgroup_id=54874112525&placement=&ref=&adname=210401_SC_RSA_MMWL_V1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2ZCOBhDiARIsAMRfv9Lek_vwIst6HIq_bu11IKFQomD7eDRxzlduC8fHNMHJz6XYdI4DbD0aAtBREALw_wcB) offering their services to get the people to move to their destination on time. 

## Challenges
One of the challenges with the cab reservation system is that an user is not able to get an accurate estimated time it takes for the driver to pickup in their current location. Furthermore, user interface (UI) for cab reservation is often complex which makes the user enter a lot of details before even booking a ride initially. As a result, this slows down the process overall of picking an user respectively.

 ## Solution 
We considered this project and thought of combating these challenges with the aid of __MySQL__ and __Flask__. We've built an interactive UI that takes minimal information about the user along with providing the most accurate estimate of the wait time. 

As an end product, we get an UI that is quite easy for the user to understand and book a ride. In addition to this, machine learning is used to get the accurate estimates of the time it takes for the driver to arrive on time.
